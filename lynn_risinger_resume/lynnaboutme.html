	<h2><strong>Who Is Lynn Risinger?</strong></h2>
	
	<p>I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Portland,Oregon (Beaverton to be exact) with my best friend and brother, Stewart. My mom, Debbie, enrolled me in a gymnastics class ate the age of 6 and I soon fell in love with the sport. I was fortunate to compete in Artistic Gymnastics for 10 years, Competitive Cheerleading for 2 years and <a href="http://thencata.org/landing/index"> Acrobatics and Tumbling</a> at the University of Oregon for 4 years. <strong>Go Ducks!</strong>

	<h2><strong>Currently: </strong></h2>
	<p>I am enrolled in a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly located in San Fransisco,Ca.  I am looking forward to exploring the world of programming and using my knowledge to create complex, beautiful and user-friendly programs.</p>	


	<h2><strong>Education and Recent History:</strong></h2>
	<p>From the time I was a little girl I can remember watching the History Channel and I became quickly fascinated with the numerous events and time periods since the beginning of time. I have always had a particular interest in Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and World War II history. This led to earning my Bachelor of Arts degree in History from the University of Oregon in June 2013.</p>

	<p>I then moved the Berlin, Germany to pursue my dream job of being a tour guide in one of the most fascinating cities in the world. I was also an Au Pair for a German family for 6 months but ultimately moved back to the United States in January 2014.</p>

	<p>Santa Cruz became my new home in September of 2014 after my better half, Steve, finished his degree at the University of Oregon in History as well. We recently moved to the Mountain View area and are commuting up to San Francisco in order to pursue a career in Web Development. </p>

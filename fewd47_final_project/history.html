	<h2>Ancient History</h2>
	<p>
     Gymnastics has been around for about 2,000 years and dates back to ancient Greece. The word 'Gymnastics' comes from the ancient words 'Gymnos' and 'gymnazo' meaning roughly to train and exercise naked. Many gladiators and warriors trained in gymnastics because it was mainly thought of as agility training for war. The 'Great Grandfather' of gymnastics is thought to be Johann Christoph Friedrich Gutsmuths, who was a German teacher and educator during the 1700's. He published a textbook in 1793 title "Gymnastics for Youth: or a Practical Guide to Healthful and Amusing Exercises for the use of Schools". A fellow German is commonly thought of as the 'father' of gymnnastics, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. He was originally a member of the Prussian Army in the early 1800s but after a battle in which the Prussian Army was defeated, Friedrich Jahn came up with the idea of improving morale by improving physical and mental strength through gymnastics. He opened the first open air gymnasium in 1811. Most of the early training in gymnastics focused on getting and staying in strong physical and mental strength. The only known events at Jahn's first gymnasium was the Parallel Bars, Rings, and High Bar. Nowadays these are events only male gymnasts perform.

	<h2>Modern History</h2>
	
    <h4>International and USA Gymnastics Organization</h4>
        <p>
          'In 1881 gymnastics became an “organized    sport” when the Bureau of the European     Gymnastics Federation, which would later    become the International Gymnastics    Federation (FIG) was formed. FIG is the    current international gymnastics governing     body. Gymnastics was becoming more popular  and was included in the first “modern”   Olympic Games in 1896. At this time the   gymnastics events were different than they    are today, they included some events that are  currently part of Track and Field. Some of   the events competed were men’s horizontal     bar, parallel bars, pommel horse, rings,    vault, high jumping, rope climbing and     running. Track and Field events didn’t  disappear from the sport of gymnastics until     1954. Women weren’t allowed to compete at Olympic gymnastic events until the 1920s.'</p>

        <p>
         'The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) became the first formal governing body for gymnastics in the United State in 1883. In 1970 a separate entity just for gymnastics was formed, the United States Gymnastics Federation, now known as USA Gymnastics. Today USA Gymnastics is the main gymnastics governing body with its own rules, but some gyms and gymnasts compete under a different set of AAU gymnastic rules. At the 1956 Olympic Games the gymnastics events for both men and women became like what we know today as Artistic Gymnastics. Women competed the four events: Vault, Uneven Bars, Balance Beam, and the Floor Exercise. Men also competed the events we have today: Floor Exercise, Parallel Bars, Horizontal Bar, Pommel Horse, Rings and Vault.'

    <h4>Influences from the Soviet Union</h4>
    <p>
        Since gymnastics basically originated in Germany, its no surprise that the Germans showed dominance early. They won the team gold at the 1936 Olympic Games. But after that the Soviet Union quickly took over in shaping modern gymnastics history.

        The Soviet Union set a precedent early. They performed extremely difficult gymnastics routines with great discipline and artistry. And because of that they dominated the Olympic team competition between 1952 and 1992. They won the team gold medal at every Olympic games they attended during that time period (The Soviet Union boycotted the Olympics in 1984) . Other countries continuously on the leader board during this time period were other Eastern European countries, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Eastern Germany.

        In the 1970s gymnastics really grew in popularity due to television coverage of the 1972 and 1976 Olympics.  Olga Korbut, a gymnast from the Soviet Union, was the star of the 1972 Olympics. She won both the Beam and Floor Exercise gold medals, helping her team win a gold medal.

        At the 1976 Olympics gymnastics history was made when Nadia Comaneci, a Romanian gymnast, received the first perfect score. Her coach was Bela Károlyi.

    <h4>Marta and Bela Karolyi's Influence on Gymnastics</h4>
    <p>
        It would be impossible to talk about the history of gymnastics in the US and not discuss Bela and Márta Károlyi. Bela Károlyi defected to the US in 1981, from Romania, and become a huge influence on American gymnastics along with his wife, Márta. After Bela Károlyi moved to the US he was invited to be an investor in a Houston, TX gymnastics gym. The gym ran into financial problems, and the Károlyi’s bought the gym. His fame as “Nadia Comaneci’s coach” attracted talented gymnasts to his gym. He was back at the Olympics in 1984 as Mary Lou Retton’s coach; she won the individual all-around gold medal. In 1988 he was named head coach of the US Women’s Gymnastics Team.
        He became the coach to train with in the US if you wanted to be an Olympic gymnast. At the 1991 World Championships, four of the six gymnasts on the US Women’s team were trained by Károlyi and the other two were trained by ex-Károlyi gym club coaches. And the 1992 Olympics showed his domination again, when Károlyi was head coach, five of the seven-gymnast team were trained by either him or one of his protégés.

    <h4>1996 Olympics and the Magnificient Seven</h4>
    
    <img id='magnificient7' src='http://az801229.vo.msecnd.net/wetpaint/2016/07/magnificent-7-now-1996-olympics-750x522.jpg'>  
  
    <p>
        The 1996 US Olympic team was known as the magnificent seven. The seven members of the team were Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Dominique Dawes, Kerri Strug, Amy Chow, Amanda Borden and Jaycie Phelps. Both Dominique Moceanu and Kerri Strug trained under Károlyi.

        Up to this time the team competition at the Olympics had been dominated by the Russians and had never been won by the US. At the 1996 team competition, the US was competing against Russian, Romanian and Ukranian teams. Going into the final rotation the US had a .897 point lead over the Russian team. The US could win their first ever team gold medal as long as they didn’t collapse on their last event, Vault. The first four vaulters performed decent vaults, with the fifth vaulter Dominique Moceanu falling twice. The last vaulter was Kerri Strug. She performed her first vault, landed it, but in the process hurt her ankle. Strug needed to land a second vault to mathematically clinch the gold. She managed to perform the second vault on her hurt ankle, stuck it, saluted the judges and almost immediately collapsed to her knees.

        One of the most memorable and famous moments of the 1996 Olympics was Károlyi carrying Strug to the podium to accept her goal medal. She had become a national sports hero by performing on her hurt ankle to guarantee an American gold medal.

        Bela Károlyi retired from coaching gymnastics after the 1996 Olympics. However, that was not it for him and his wife’s influence on US gymnastics history.

         After the success of the US gymnastics team at the 1996 Olympic games, USA gymnastics lost traction. The US left both the 1997 and 1999 World Championships without a single medal.

        Bela Károlyi came out of retirement to try to pull a struggling US gymnastics program out of its lull, with his hiring as National Team Coordinator in 1999.  As the coordinator Károlyi required team members to attend grueling camps at his Texas gymnastics ranch. Some gymnasts spoke out about the grueling and frequent nature of these camps and his coaching style. After he failed to produce a medal for the US at the 2000 Olympics, the title of National Team Coordinator was handed over to his wife, Márta.

        Márta Károlyi’s approach seems to be slightly softer and more acceptable to coaches and gymnasts. She is still the current National Team Coordinator but will retire after the Rio 2016 Olympics.

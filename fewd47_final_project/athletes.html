     <img class='img-responsive' src='images/gabbybio.jpg'>
     <p class='bioparagraph'> Gabby Douglas was born on December 31, 1995 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She began training at 6 years old and quickly excelled at the sport. She moved away from her hometown in 2010 to pursue better training with Liang Chow, a world-renowned gymnastics coach, and was able to make a name for herself on the World stage as the American Women won All-Around Team gold in 2011 at the World Artistic Gymnastic Championships in Tokyo. Her amazing power combined with her flexibility made her an unstoppable force. Gabby was eventually named to the 2012 Olympic Team to compete in London. She was the first African-American woman to win the individual All-Around gold and also a major contributor for the Team Event where her and 4 of her teammates won the All-Around Team Gold. Gabby returned to the competition floor in 2015 in hopes of making the 2016 Rio Olympic team. Although she did not have a great showing at the Olympic Trials in July 2016 she was still named as one of the top five for the Olympic team. She had a great showing at the 2016 Rio Olympics and helped the USA Women earn the gold medal in the All-Around Team event. Gabby placed 3rd out of 61 competitors but due to a new rule that only allows two women from each country to compete in the individual All-Around event, Gabby was cut short. She had a chance at an inidividual medal on the Uneven Bars event but made a small mistake that cost her to earn 7th place. She is now moving forward to being a judge for the Miss America Pageant as well as other entrepreneurial endeavors.
